# Machine Problem for Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Josephus Mingle is a simple simulation inspired by the popular Netflix series *Squid Game*.  
Our program implements the Josephus Problem Algorithm in the game mechanics of Mingle. In this algorithm, a defined number of players are eliminated in a circular pattern until only one remainsâ€”just like in the show's nerve-wracking games. Can you survive?
