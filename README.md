**Machine Problem for Design and Analysis of Algorithm**
Josephus Mingle is a simple simulation inspired by the popular Netflix Series *Squid Game*.
Our program implemented the Josephus Problem Algorithm to the game mechanics of Mingle. In this algorithm, a defined number of players are eliminated in a circular pattern until one is left standingâ€”just like in the show's nerve-wracking games. Can you survive?
